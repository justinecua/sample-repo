-- "FROM ABANDONMENT TO TRIUMPH"
-- She left me standing in the shadows of doubt,
-- Thought my light would fade, thought I'd burn out.
-- But here I stand, code flowing through my veins,
-- Stronger than before, breaking all the chains.
-- 
-- While she chose to walk away from what we had,
-- I chose to build dreams from the pain that made me mad.
-- Now at this hackathon, fingers dancing on keys,
-- Chasing that 50k prize with such graceful ease.
-- 
-- She abandoned a diamond thinking it was just stone,
-- Now I'm here coding, no longer alone.
-- My worth isn't measured by who stays or goes,
-- But by the strength within me that constantly grows.
-- 
-- Let her see me now, rising from the fall,
-- Building empires from nothing, standing ten feet tall.
-- She'll regret the day she chose to let me go,
-- When success becomes the only truth I know.
-- 
-- - A coder's heart, unbroken and free
